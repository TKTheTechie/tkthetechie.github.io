In my nearly two decades leading engineering teams, I've seen countless technologies rise and fall, architectures evolve, and methodologies shift. Now, as the VP of Systems Engineering at Solace, leading a team of 15 pre-sales engineers, some might wonder why I still find myself diving into pull requests, building personal projects with SvelteKit and Cloudflare, or even occasionally debugging a race condition in Go. The answer is simple: being a 'hands-on VP' isn't a hobby; it's a strategic imperative.

My journey has given me a unique perspective on the true value of being deeply immersed in the technology. **When I was at Deutsche Bank, spending nearly a decade running mission-critical real-time trading systems, I truly learned the meaning of resilience and performance.** I had the privilege of spearheading the firm-wide migration from TIBCO Rendezvous to Solace. This wasn't just an architectural decision; it was about understanding the nuances of low-latency trading, the stability of Core Java and KDB+, and the total cost of ownership (TCO) implications of our messaging infrastructure. Being in the trenches, experiencing Solace technology as a high-stakes user before ever joining the company, solidified my belief that deep technical understanding isn't just for the individual contributor – it's crucial for leaders to truly grasp the impact of architectural choices, especially for something as fundamental as Event-Driven Architecture (EDA).

This conviction only deepened in my next role. **At Capital One, when we moved to GoLang for microservices, the speed difference was transformative.** As a manager, I led a new team building robust microservices in AWS using Agile methodologies. I personally architected high-performance microservices in GoLang and mission-critical Java Spring Boot services for credit card controls. But it wasn't just about the tech; it was about building the team. I piloted the engineering internship program and mentored developers, knowing that to truly guide them, I needed to speak their language and understand their daily challenges. Getting into the code, even at a management level, allowed me to provide practical guidance and foster a culture of technical excellence.

Today, at Solace, my role involves bridging the gap between incredibly complex distributed systems and tangible business value. My team of pre-sales engineers (which I've scaled from 5 to 15) relies on a leader who understands not just the 'what' but the 'how' and 'why' of our technology. When I review a PR, it's not about micromanaging. It's about:

*   **Staying Current:** Technology moves at a blistering pace. My personal passion for building with modern stacks like SvelteKit and Cloudflare (Workers/Pages/R2), coupled with my foundational expertise in Java, GoLang, and even experimentation with Rust, keeps me fluent in the latest paradigms.
*   **Guiding Architecture:** As a proponent of EDA, having seen its power at the scale of a global bank, I can offer informed architectural guidance that resonates because it's grounded in practical experience, not just theory.
*   **Mentorship and Empathy:** Understanding the actual code, the challenges of integration, or the intricacies of debugging allows me to better mentor my team, anticipating roadblocks and offering solutions born from experience.
*   **Connecting Tech to Business:** When I understand the granular details of our systems, I can more effectively articulate their value to customers, translating technical capabilities into strategic business advantages and understanding their TCO implications.

Being a 'hands-on VP' isn't about proving I can still code; it's about leading with informed empathy, fostering technical excellence, and ensuring that Solace continues to innovate with solutions that truly solve our customers' most complex distributed systems challenges. For me, the merge button isn't just for code – it's for connecting strategy, execution, and real-world impact.

As an engineering leader with nearly two decades spanning fintech and complex systems architecture, I’ve refined my approach to building high-performing teams, often through trial by fire. But one of the most profound shifts in my hiring philosophy didn't come from a high-stakes migration or architecting a new microservices platform; it came from an unexpected source: running an intern program at Capital One.

My career has been a journey through some of the most demanding technical landscapes imaginable. From the ultra-low-latency world of real-time trading at Deutsche Bank to architecting cloud-native microservices at Capital One, and now leading Systems Engineering for Solace's cutting-edge Agent Mesh, I've seen firsthand what it takes to build resilient, high-impact systems. And what I've learned is that the 'how' you hire is just as critical as the 'what' you build.

### The Old Rubric: Pedigree Over Potential

When I was at Deutsche Bank, managing enterprise messaging systems, our world was one of absolute precision and unwavering uptime. For nearly a decade, I ran mission-critical real-time trading systems. Our firm-wide migration from TIBCO Rendezvous to Solace was a monumental undertaking, requiring deep expertise in Core Java, KDB+, and the intricate nuances of low-latency trading support. In that environment, hiring often prioritized a proven track record. We looked for candidates who had not just *used* Java, but lived and breathed it, who had navigated the complexities of enterprise middleware, and who could jump in and immediately contribute to systems where a single millisecond could mean millions.

This approach, while effective for maintaining stability in highly specialized domains, often narrowed our focus. We sought existing expertise, specific language proficiencies, and direct domain experience. It was a strategy born of necessity: when the stakes are that high, the instinct is to minimize risk by bringing in known quantities. But as I would soon learn, this approach, while safe, could sometimes overlook a far more valuable asset: raw potential.

### The Catalyst: Capital One's Internship Program

Moving to Capital One was a different kind of challenge. I managed a new team building microservices in AWS, embracing Agile methodologies, and pushing the boundaries with GoLang for high-performance systems alongside mission-critical Java Spring Boot services. It was an exciting period of rapid innovation and scaling.

Amidst this rapid change, I was given the opportunity to pilot an engineering internship program. Honestly, my initial mindset wasn't far from my Deutsche Bank days: I expected to find junior engineers who could slot into specific tasks, perhaps help with some ancillary development, and hopefully show enough promise to be considered for full-time roles. I was looking for smaller versions of experienced developers, testing for existing knowledge and familiar frameworks.

But what transpired fundamentally reshaped my hiring rubric. Observing interns, day in and day out, provided an unfiltered view of engineering talent. I remember one intern who, despite having only basic Java experience, tackled a performance bottleneck in a GoLang microservice. We were seeing inconsistent latency spikes in a critical payment processing flow. While they didn't know Go out-of-the-box, they possessed an innate curiosity. They didn't just look for a quick fix; they dug into the goroutine scheduling, the mutex usage, and how channels were being managed. Their ability to debug a race condition, identify deadlocks, or suggest a more efficient concurrency pattern wasn't about knowing `Go` syntax; it was about understanding fundamental distributed systems principles and having the tenacity to apply them in an unfamiliar environment. This is the kind of potential that a resume often hides.

Watching these young engineers grapple with new technologies – be it AWS services, GoLang concurrency, or Spring Boot configurations – illuminated a set of traits far more predictive of long-term success than any specific line item on a resume. They demonstrated: 

*   **Intellectual Curiosity:** A relentless drive to understand the 'why' behind systems, not just the 'how.'
*   **Learnability:** The astonishing speed at which they could pick up new languages, frameworks, and architectural patterns.
*   **Problem-Solving Agility:** Their capacity to decompose complex, unfamiliar problems and iterate towards a solution, even when the path wasn't clear.
*   **Collaborative Spirit:** A willingness to ask 'dumb' questions, seek feedback, and contribute meaningfully to team discussions, even when they felt out of their depth.

### The New Rubric: Prioritizing Learnability and Problem Solving

This experience at Capital One wasn't just about finding future employees; it was about recalibrating my entire perspective on talent. My rubric shifted from *what* someone knew to *how* they learned and *how* they approached problems. Today, when I interview, I'm less concerned with whether a candidate has five years of experience in a specific framework and more interested in their ability to articulate a complex problem, their curiosity about emerging technologies, and their capacity to adapt.

This ethos mirrors my own journey as a 'hands-on VP.' While my roots are firmly in hardcore backend systems like Java, Go, and KDB+, I've found immense satisfaction recently in building with SvelteKit and Cloudflare (Workers/Pages/R2), and I've experimented with Rust. This continuous learning isn't just a hobby; it's a necessity. It’s what allowed me to transition from running enterprise messaging to architecting microservices, and now to spearheading AI initiatives. I advocate for Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) because I've seen its power at the scale of a global bank, and EDA itself demands flexible thinking, an understanding of complex system interactions, and the ability to design for resilience – traits that align perfectly with a learn-first mindset.

### Building the Future: Solace Agent Mesh and Adaptable Talent

Now, as the VP of Systems Engineering at Solace, leading Solutions Engineering for our brand new Agent Mesh in the Americas, this revised rubric is more critical than ever. We're not just selling a product; we're launching a cutting-edge AI solution that defines a new paradigm for intelligent, real-time interactions. There's no existing playbook for this.

Building the team for Solace Agent Mesh demands engineers who can not only bridge the gap between complex distributed systems and business value but also: 

*   **Navigate Uncharted Territory:** Understand the nascent market landscape for agentic AI and identify product-market fit.
*   **Strategic Acumen:** Analyze competitors and position our unique value proposition.
*   **Rapid Skill Acquisition:** Quickly scale and skill up on brand new AI technologies and paradigms, from LLM integrations to orchestrating autonomous agents.

Traditional hiring for specific 'AI Engineer' titles simply won't cut it. We need systems thinkers, problem solvers, those who understand the robustness required for enterprise-grade distributed systems, *and* possess the agility and curiosity to rapidly master the nuances of AI. My experience at Deutsche Bank gave me a deep appreciation for Solace's technology in high-stakes environments, making me acutely aware of the need for engineers who can combine that foundation with a hunger for innovation.

How do we spot someone who can debug a race condition in Go *and* grasp the complex orchestration of an LLM agentic workflow? It’s not about checking off boxes on a list of known technologies. It's about identifying that fundamental engineering curiosity, that tenacity to learn, and that ability to adapt in a world where today's cutting-edge technology is tomorrow's legacy.

### Conclusion

My time at Capital One, fostering an internship program, wasn't just about cultivating a talent pipeline; it was a profound recalibration of my own hiring instruments. It taught me that potential, manifested through curiosity, learnability, and problem-solving agility, is often a far better predictor of long-term success than any pre-existing technical mastery. As we navigate the complexities of AI and the future of distributed systems at Solace, nurturing and identifying this potential is not just a strategic advantage—it's an absolute necessity for building the teams that will define tomorrow’s innovations.

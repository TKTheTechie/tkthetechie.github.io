  "title": "Beyond Resumes: How Capital One's Intern Program Rewrote My Hiring Playbook",
  "content": "As a Vice President of Systems Engineering at Solace, leading a team that bridges the intricate world of distributed systems with tangible business value, I've spent nearly two decades navigating the complex currents of fintech and systems architecture. From building high-performance microservices at Capital One to spearheading a firm-wide migration to Solace at Deutsche Bank, my career has been defined by a constant evolution of technology and strategy.\n\nYet, for all the advancements in cloud, EDA, and polyglot architectures, one of the most profound shifts in my professional journey wasn't about a new framework or a groundbreaking platform. It was about people. Specifically, it was about how running an engineering internship program at Capital One fundamentally altered my entire hiring rubric, moving me beyond the traditional checklist to a deeper understanding of true potential.\n\n### The Old Playbook: Skills, Experience, and the Grind\n\nFor years, like many engineering leaders, my hiring approach was heavily anchored in demonstrable skills and years of experience. When I was at Deutsche Bank, running mission-critical real-time trading systems, the stakes were incredibly high. We needed battle-hardened engineers who knew Core Java inside out, understood KDB+ queries that could impact millions of dollars in milliseconds, and could provide low-latency trading support without breaking a sweat. The focus was on what you *already* knew, and your ability to hit the ground running on systems that had been meticulously built over years.\n\nInterviews often revolved around deep technical dives, complex algorithmic challenges, and a forensic examination of past projects to prove mastery. While this approach certainly yielded competent engineers, I began to sense a limitation. We were excellent at identifying *proficient* candidates, but were we truly spotting *potential*? Were we overlooking brilliant minds simply because their experience didn't perfectly align with a specific tech stack or tenure requirement?\n\n### A New Frontier: Piloting the Internship Program at Capital One\n\nMy perspective began to truly evolve during my time as a Manager at Capital One. I was leading a new team, building critical microservices in AWS using Agile methodologies. We were pushing the envelope, architecting high-performance services in GoLang and mission-critical Java Spring Boot applications for credit card controls. It was an environment of rapid change, continuous learning, and innovation.\n\nIt was here that I had the opportunity to pilot the engineering internship program. Initially, I approached it with a standard mindset: bring in bright students, give them some tasks, and see if they could contribute. What unfolded, however, was far more transformative than I anticipated.\n\nWe didn't just give interns trivial tasks. We embedded them directly into our scrum teams. They worked on real features, contributed to our GoLang microservices, and helped build out components of our Java Spring Boot applications. They faced the same challenges as our full-time engineers – debugging race conditions, dealing with cloud deployments, and integrating with complex APIs.\n\nFor example, I remember an intern who, despite having only academic experience with Java, was assigned to a GoLang service. Rather than being deterred, she embraced the challenge with an incredible thirst for knowledge. She spent her evenings diving into Go tutorials, asking incredibly insightful questions during stand-ups, and collaborating tirelessly with her mentors. Within weeks, she was contributing meaningful code, not just to the GoLang service, but even helping to identify an optimization for a latency-sensitive Spring Boot component by applying principles she'd learned. The speed difference when we moved to GoLang for some of these microservices was significant, but her ability to quickly pivot and master a new paradigm was even more telling than the language itself.\n\n### The Revelation: What Interns Taught Me About True Talent\n\nWatching these interns navigate ambiguity, embrace new technologies, and contribute meaningfully in such a short period cracked open my entire understanding of talent. My hiring rubric shifted dramatically. It wasn't just about what they knew, but *how they learned*, *how they adapted*, and *how they collaborated*.\n\nHere's what I learned to value above all else:\n\n*   **Curiosity and Learnability:** Did they ask probing questions? Were they actively seeking knowledge, even outside their immediate task? The ability to self-teach and absorb new information quickly became paramount in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. At Solace, where we deal with sophisticated event-driven architectures and clients often have unique integration challenges, this trait is indispensable for our pre-sales engineers.\n*   **Resilience and Problem-Solving Grit:** Software engineering is messy. Debugging is a core competency. I saw interns face blockers, get frustrated, but then persist, experiment, and eventually break through. This resilience, this unwavering commitment to solving a problem, even when the path isn't clear, became a top indicator of future success. It's the difference between someone who can write code and someone who can *deliver* a solution.\n*   **Communication and Collaboration:** Being able to articulate technical challenges, ask for help effectively, and provide clear updates is crucial. The best interns weren't just coding; they were integrating with the team, participating in discussions, and contributing to the collective knowledge. This is particularly vital in pre-sales, where bridging the gap between deep tech and business needs is core to the role.\n*   **Initiative and Ownership:** Those who took ownership of their projects, even small ones, and looked for ways to improve beyond the explicit requirements, always stood out. This proactive mindset is what drives innovation and propels teams forward.\n\n### Applying the New Rubric: From Capital One to Solace\n\nThis experience didn't just inform my approach to intern hiring; it reshaped my philosophy for every hire thereafter. At Solace, as a VP of Systems Engineering, I'm now looking for these intrinsic qualities even more keenly. While a strong background in distributed systems, Java, or GoLang is certainly beneficial, it's the underlying capacity for growth and adaptability that truly grabs my attention.\n\nWhen I interview candidates for my team now, I focus less on rote answers to complex data structure problems and more on their thought process when presented with ambiguous architectural challenges. I'm keen to understand how they approach a new technology (like SvelteKit or Cloudflare Workers/Pages/R2, which I've been loving to build with recently, or even Rust, which I've experimented with) or a complex system like an Event-Driven Architecture. We might discuss the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) implications of different architectural choices, or dive into the practicalities of debugging a race condition in a Go service – but the emphasis is on *how* they think through it, not just *what* they know from memory.\n\nFor instance, the journey from TIBCO Rendezvous to Solace at Deutsche Bank, which I spearheaded, wasn't just a technical migration; it was a cultural shift towards a more resilient and scalable messaging infrastructure. Explaining the nuances of an EDA and its business value requires more than just knowing a particular messaging broker; it demands a deep understanding of data flow, business implications, and the ability to articulate complex concepts clearly – skills that stem directly from learnability and communication.\n\n### The Hands-On VP's Perspective: Technical Depth with Adaptability\n\nMy technical philosophy is that of a "hands-on VP." My background is hardcore backend and systems, but I constantly experiment and learn new things. I love building with SvelteKit and Cloudflare, even as my core professional work might involve robust Java services or intricate GoLang applications. This continuous learning is not just a personal hobby; it's a professional necessity in our field. Therefore, when building a team, I seek out individuals who embody this same spirit. They might have deep expertise in one area, but crucially, they possess the intellectual curiosity and resilience to dive into another.\n\n### Conclusion: Investing in Potential, Building for the Future\n\nRunning that internship program at Capital One was an unexpected masterclass in talent acquisition. It taught me that while skills can be taught, and experience gained, the core attributes of curiosity, resilience, and a genuine passion for learning are far rarer and more valuable commodities. Investing in potential isn't just about being altruistic; it's a strategic imperative that builds stronger, more adaptable, and ultimately more innovative engineering teams capable of tackling the challenges of tomorrow. My hiring rubric was rewritten, and my teams, both past and present, are all the better for it.\n",

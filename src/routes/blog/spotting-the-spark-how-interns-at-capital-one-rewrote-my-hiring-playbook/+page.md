As a Systems Engineering VP at Solace, leading a team that’s scaled from 5 to 15, and now spearheading our go-to-market strategy for Agentic AI, the ability to identify and cultivate talent is more critical than ever. But my current hiring rubric isn't one I was born with; it's a philosophy forged in the crucible of real-world challenges, deeply influenced by a specific chapter in my career: piloting the engineering internship program at Capital One.

### The Old Playbook: Experience, Experience, Experience

For much of my nearly two-decade journey in fintech and systems architecture, my hiring lens was, admittedly, quite traditional. Back when I was an Enterprise Messaging Lead at Deutsche Bank, running mission-critical real-time trading systems, the stakes were incredibly high. We were migrating from TIBCO Rendezvous to Solace – a massive undertaking that demanded deep expertise in core Java, KDB+, and a meticulous understanding of low-latency trading support.

In that environment, my default was to look for candidates who had *already* been there, done that. I sought out resumes filled with specific technologies and years of battle-tested experience. The logic was sound: why take a risk when precision and immediate impact were paramount? We needed engineers who could step in, understand a complex system architecture, perhaps debug a gnarly race condition, and contribute from day one. This approach delivered results, but in hindsight, it also created blind spots, often overlooking raw, untapped potential.

### A New Arena: Capital One and the Microservices Frontier

My move to Capital One was a significant pivot, professionally and philosophically. I joined as a Manager, tasked with building a new team focused on architecting high-performance microservices in AWS using GoLang and mission-critical Java Spring Boot services for credit card controls. This was a different beast: a large enterprise embracing agile methodologies, cloud-native architectures, and a culture of rapid iteration. It was during this period that I was asked to pilot the engineering internship program – a responsibility that would utterly transform my understanding of talent.

Initially, I approached the intern program with a slightly modified version of my 'experience-first' rubric. I looked for academic excellence, prior small projects, anything that hinted at a 'mini-engineer' ready to slot in. But the magic of the intern program wasn't in finding mini-engineers; it was in observing how nascent talent, given the right environment and mentorship, could *bloom*.

### The Revelation: What Interns Taught Me About True Potential

Working with those interns shattered my old hiring biases. I quickly realized that the traditional markers I prioritized weren't the only, or even the most important, indicators of long-term success. Here's what those bright young minds taught me:

1.  **Curiosity Trumps Specific Experience:** Many interns had limited or no prior exposure to enterprise-level GoLang, AWS, or Spring Boot. Yet, their insatiable curiosity was a force multiplier. I recall one intern, tasked with developing a critical piece of a new microservice in GoLang. They hadn't written a line of Go before. But their constant "why" questions, their dive into documentation, and their willingness to experiment meant they not only delivered the feature but also brought fresh perspectives on optimization we hadn't considered. This isn't just about learning syntax; it's about understanding the underlying principles and challenging assumptions.

2.  **Problem-Solving Aptitude Over Pre-packaged Solutions:** When you haven't been exposed to a hundred different ways to solve a problem, you're forced to think from first principles. Our microservices in AWS presented unique distributed systems challenges. An experienced engineer might reach for a known pattern; an intern, unburdened by past solutions, might stumble, but they'd *learn* by genuinely dissecting the problem. For instance, debugging a tricky race condition in a Go service wasn't just about knowing Go's concurrency primitives; it was about systematically tracing data flow and state changes – a fundamental problem-solving skill that interns often developed rapidly because they *had* to.

3.  **Adaptability and Learning Velocity are Gold:** Capital One's rapid shift to cloud-native and microservices demanded immense adaptability. Engineers needed to learn new paradigms, tools, and processes constantly. The interns, without years of 'unlearning' to do, often embraced these changes with remarkable speed. They absorbed event-driven architecture (EDA) concepts, which I champion, with an enthusiasm that sometimes surpassed seasoned engineers accustomed to more monolithic approaches. Their learning velocity was a testament to a growth mindset, which I now value above almost all else.

4.  **Resilience and a Hunger for Feedback:** Interns, by definition, are there to learn. They expected feedback, absorbed it, and applied it. They weren't afraid to fail because failure was part of the learning process. This resilience and openness to iteration are crucial in any fast-paced engineering environment, particularly now at Solace as we navigate the nascent and rapidly evolving landscape of Agentic AI. The ability to pivot, iterate, and refine based on market feedback is a direct parallel to an intern's learning journey.

### Applying the New Rubric: From Interns to VPs

This experience at Capital One fundamentally reshaped my hiring rubric, not just for entry-level roles, but for every position on my team. When I hire now, whether it's for a Solutions Engineer at Solace or someone to help us scale our Agent Mesh offering, I look for:

*   **Genuine Technical Curiosity:** Do they ask insightful questions? Do they explore beyond the immediate problem? Can they articulate complex distributed systems concepts simply?
*   **Demonstrated Problem-Solving Skills:** Not just 'what did you do,' but 'how did you think through it?' What was your process when you hit a wall?
*   **Adaptability and a Growth Mindset:** Are they excited by new technologies? (Think SvelteKit, Cloudflare, Rust, and of course, our cutting-edge AI Agent Mesh). Can they embrace new paradigms quickly?
*   **Communication and Collaboration:** How well do they explain complex technical challenges and business value? Can they bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical impact?

This shift has been invaluable. It allows me to build a diverse, dynamic team, like the one I lead at Solace, where we’re not just executing but also innovating. We're bridging the gap between complex distributed systems and business value, and that requires engineers who can not only write robust Java or GoLang but also conceptualize, learn, and adapt.

### The Lasting Impact

Running that intern program at Capital One wasn't just about giving young engineers a foot in the door; it was about opening my own eyes to a richer definition of potential. It taught me that while experience provides a strong foundation, true engineering excellence is often built on a bedrock of curiosity, adaptability, and an unyielding desire to learn and solve problems.

For any engineering leader, I cannot emphasize enough the value of investing in developing talent from the ground up. It’s not just about finding your next great hire; it’s about refining your own ability to spot the spark that ignites innovation. It's about recognizing that sometimes, the freshest perspectives yield the most profound breakthroughs.
